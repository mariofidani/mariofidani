👋 Hi, I’m @mariofidani
🌏 I'm passionate about traveling and exploring the depths of Eastern culture – from philosophy to traditions, and everything in between!
📘 Always curious, always learning. Whether it's diving into code or unraveling the mysteries of new destinations, I love immersing myself in fascinating worlds.
⚡ Fun Fact: "Throughout Heaven and Earth, I Alone Am The Honored One." – A little mantra of mine, inspired by G.S.
